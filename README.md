# Factorio-Revenge-of-the-Explosion

## What it is
This is a modification for the great factoring game "[Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/game/content)" that let all entities explode after destroy. If you damage entities like trees, stones, walls, ovens and as well enemies they will destroy in a big explosion. But stay calm because this action did not affect any other object around your target. Its simply replace the destroy animation with an explosion.

This mod is not my own idea. This is a fork of madmaster5000 great mod 'Factorio, Directed by Michael Bay' (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorio%20Directed%20by%20Michael%20Bay) which unfortunately no longer receives updates and is outdated. I just patched it to the current Factorio version, re-released it and will update it time by time.
